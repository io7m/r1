/**
 * <p>
 * The type of framebuffer configurations suitable for forward rendering, with
 * a depth buffer that can be sampled (for shadow mapping and similar
 * techniques).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementation note: On platforms that support depth textures, a single
 * framebuffer will be allocated with an RGBA texture color attachment, and a
 * depth-texture depth attachment. In this case,
 * {@link #kFramebufferGetColorFramebuffer()} ==
 * {@link #kFramebufferGetDepthPassFramebuffer()}. On platforms that do not
 * support depth textures, two framebuffers <tt>F0</tt> and <tt>F1</tt> will
 * be allocated. <tt>F0</tt> will consist of an RGBA texture color attachment
 * and a depth renderbuffer <tt>R</tt>, and <tt>F1</tt> will consist of an
 * RGBA texture to which packed depth values will be encoded, and the same
 * depth renderbuffer <tt>R</tt>. Consult
 * {@link #kFramebufferGetDepthIsPackedColour()}.
