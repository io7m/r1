      Because the <s:term s:type="package">${project.parent.name}</s:term> package
      implements <s:term s:type="term">local illumination</s:term>, it is necessary
      to associate <s:term s:type="term">shadows</s:term> with those light sources
      capable of projecting them (currently only 
      <s:link s:target="r1.dai.lighting-projective">projective</s:link> lights).
      The <s:term s:type="package">${project.parent.name}</s:term> package currently
      supports <s:link s:target="r1.dai.shadow-mapping-basic">basic</s:link> and
      <s:link s:target="r1.dai.shadow-mapping-variance">variance</s:link> 
      <s:term s:type="term">shadow mapping</s:term>. So-called
      <s:term s:type="term">mapped</s:term> shadows allow efficient per-pixel
      shadows to be calculated with varying degrees of visual quality.

    <s:paragraph>
      The <s:term s:type="package">${project.parent.name}</s:term> package
      creates new shadow maps on demand during rendering, and the maps are
      returned to a soft-bounded <s:footnote>
        In other words, the cache tries to keep itself to a given
        maximum size, but is permitted to overstep these bounds if asked: A
        scene that has <s:term s:type="expression">100</s:term> shadow
        casting lights requires <s:term s:type="expression">100</s:term>
        pre-populated shadow maps, regardless of whether or not this would
        exceed the stated maximum cache size.
      </s:footnote>
      cache after use. This implies that in a visible
      set with <s:term s:type="expression">n</s:term> shadow-projecting lights,
      there will be at least <s:term s:type="expression">n</s:term> shadow maps 
      allocated and in use at any one time. Shadow maps are requested from the cache
      based on their
      <s:link-external s:target="apidocs/com/io7m/r1/kernel/types/KShadowMapDescriptionType.html">map description</s:link-external>,
      and unused maps are discarded from the cache after a configurable time
      period. The intention is to avoid having to frequently allocate new
      shadow maps without requiring that all maps be allocated up-front, and
      without exhausting all available memory on shadow maps.
    </s:paragraph>
    <s:paragraph>
      The functions responsible for creating a new shadow map based on a
      map description are given in
      <s:link-external s:target="apidocs/com/io7m/r1/kernel/KShadowMapCacheLoader.html">KShadowMapCacheLoader</s:link-external>,
      with the actual map implementation for basic shadow mapping given in
      <s:link-external s:target="apidocs/com/io7m/r1/kernel/KShadowMapBasic.html">KShadowMapBasic</s:link-external>.
    </s:paragraph>
    <s:paragraph>
      The actual production of all shadow maps is managed by the
      <s:link-external s:target="apidocs/com/io7m/r1/kernel/KShadowMapRenderer.html">KShadowMapRenderer</s:link-external>
      type.
