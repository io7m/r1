      The <s:term s:type="package">${project.parent.name}</s:term> offers
      a set of simple box blurs for use on both color and
      <s:link s:target="r1.dai.shadow-mapping-variance.algorithm">depth-variance</s:link>
      data, with the effect being used on the latter to soften
      the edges of shadows.

    <s:paragraph>
      The implemented algorithm is a simple box blur separated into
      horizontal and vertical passes. The package also allows for
      scaling of the image prior to blurring, in order to use bilinear
      filtering during scaling to accentuate the blur effect. The following
      image shows a blur of size <s:term s:type="expression">1.0</s:term>
      but with the image scaled to <s:term s:type="expression">0.5</s:term>
      times its original size, the blur applied, and then the
      image scaled back up to the original size again with bilinear
      filtering:
