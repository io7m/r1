    <s:subsection-title>Algorithm</s:subsection-title>
    <s:paragraph>
      At a basic level, a projective light performs the same operations that
      occur when an ordinary 3D position is projected onto the screen during
      rendering. During normal rendering, a point <s:term s:type="expression">p</s:term>
      given in <s:link s:target="r1.dai.coords.world-space">world space</s:link>
      is transformed to <s:link s:target="r1.dai.coords.eye-space">eye space</s:link>
      given the current camera's <s:term s:type="term">view matrix</s:term>, and
      is then transformed to <s:link s:target="r1.dai.coords.clip-space">clip space</s:link>
      using the current camera's <s:term s:type="term">projection matrix</s:term>.
      During rendering of a scene lit by a projective light, a given point
      <s:term s:type="expression">q</s:term> in the scene is transformed back to
      <s:term s:type="term">world space</s:term> given the current camera's
      <s:term s:type="term">inverse view matrix</s:term>, and is then transformed
      to <s:term s:type="term">eye space from the point of view of the light</s:term>
      (subsequently referred to as <s:term s:type="term">light-eye space</s:term>)
      using the light's <s:term s:type="term">view matrix</s:term>. Finally,
      <s:term s:type="expression">q</s:term> is transformed to
      <s:term s:type="term">clip space from the point of view of the light</s:term>
      (subsequently referred to as <s:term s:type="term">light-clip space</s:term>)
      using the light's <s:term s:type="term">projection matrix</s:term>. It should
      be noted (in order to indicate that there is nothing unusual about the light's
      view or projection matrices) that if the camera and light have the same position,
      orientation, scale, and projection, then the resulting transformed values of
      <s:term s:type="expression">q</s:term> and <s:term s:type="expression">p</s:term>
      are identical. The resulting transformed value of <s:term s:type="expression">q</s:term>
      is mapped from the range <s:term s:type="expression">[(-1, -1, -1), (1, 1, 1)]</s:term>
      to <s:term s:type="expression">[(0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1)]</s:term>, and the resulting
      coordinates are used to retrieve a texel from the 2D texture associated with
      the light.
    </s:paragraph>
    <s:paragraph>
      Intuitively, an ordinary <s:term s:type="term">perspective projection</s:term> will cause
      the light to appear to take the shape of a <s:term s:type="term">frustum</s:term>:
    </s:paragraph>

    </s:formal-item>
    <s:paragraph>
      There are two issues with the projective lighting algorithm that also have to be solved: 
      <s:link s:target="r1.dai.lighting-projective.back-projection">back projection</s:link>
      and
      <s:link s:target="r1.dai.lighting-projective.clamping">clamping</s:link>.
    </s:paragraph>
  </s:subsection>

  <s:subsection xml:id="r1.dai.lighting-projective.back-projection">
    <s:subsection-title>Back projection</s:subsection-title>
    <s:paragraph>
      The <s:link s:target="r1.dai.lighting-projective.algorithm">algorithm</s:link>
      described above will produce a so-called 
      <s:term s:type="term">dual</s:term> or <s:term s:type="term">back projection</s:term>.
      In other words, the texture will be projected along the view direction of the
      camera, but will also be projected along the <s:term s:type="term">negative</s:term>
      view direction
      <s:footnote>
        The same issue occurs when performing ordinary rendering of points in a scene. The
        issue is solved there by clipping primitives based on their
        <s:term s:type="expression">w</s:term> component so that primitives that are
        "behind" the observer are not rendered.
      </s:footnote>. The visual result is that it appears that there are two projective
      lights in the scene, oriented in opposite directions. 
      As <s:link s:target="r1.dai.coords.clip-space">mentioned previously</s:link>,
      given the typical projection matrix, the <s:term s:type="expression">w</s:term>
      component of a given clip-space position is the negation of the eye-space
      <s:term s:type="expression">z</s:term> component. 
      Because it is assumed that the observer is looking towards the negative 
      <s:term s:type="expression">z</s:term> direction, all positions that are in front
      of the observer must have positive <s:term s:type="expression">w</s:term> components. 
      Therefore, if <s:term s:type="expression">w</s:term> is negative, then the position 
      is behind the observer. The standard fix for this
      problem is to check to see if the <s:term s:type="expression">w</s:term> component
      of the <s:term s:type="term">light-clip space</s:term> coordinate is negative, and
      simply return a pure black color (indicating no light contribution) rather than
      sampling from the projected texture.
    </s:paragraph>
    <s:paragraph xml:id="r1.dai.lighting-projective.back-projection.volume">
      The <s:term s:type="package">${project.parent.name}</s:term> package takes an
      arguably simpler approach to the problem. Because projective lights are only applied
      by the <s:link s:target="r1.dai.deferred">deferred renderer</s:link>, and because
      the deferred renderer uses accurate light volumes, pixels that fall outside of the
      light volume are simply not shaded (meaning that back-projection is free to occur, but
      pixels that would receive light contributions due to it are simply outside of the
      light volume). The package essentially depends on the rasterization process and
      depth testing to ensure that no pixels that would have received a back-projection
      will be shaded during rendering of the light.

  <s:subsection xml:id="r1.dai.lighting-projective.clamping">
    <s:subsection-title>Clamping</s:subsection-title>
    <s:paragraph>
      The <s:link s:target="r1.dai.lighting-projective.algorithm">algorithm</s:link>
      described above takes an arbitrary point in the scene and projects it from the
      point of view of the light. There is no guarantee that the point actually falls
      within the light's view frustum (although this is mitigated slightly by the
      <s:term s:type="package">${project.parent.name}</s:term> package's use of
      <s:link s:target="r1.dai.lighting-projective.back-projection.volume">light volumes</s:link>
      for deferred rendering), and therefore the calculated texture coordinates used
      to sample from the projected texture are not guaranteed to be in the range
      <s:term s:type="expression">[(0, 0), (1, 1)]</s:term>. In order to get the
      intended visual effect, the texture used must be set to
      <s:term s:type="term">clamp-to-edge</s:term> and have black pixels on
      all of the edges of the texture image, or <s:term s:type="term">clamp-to-border</s:term>
      with a black border color. Failing to do this can result in strange visual
      anomalies, as the texture will be unexpectedly repeated or smeared across
      the area outside of the intersection between the light volume and the
      receiving surface:
