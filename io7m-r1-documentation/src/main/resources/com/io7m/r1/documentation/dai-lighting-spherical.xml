      A <s:term s:type="term">spherical light</s:term> in the 
      <s:term s:type="package">${project.parent.name}</s:term> package
      is a light that emits rays of light in all directions from
      a given <s:term s:type="term">origin</s:term> specified in
      <s:link s:target="r1.dai.coords.eye-space">eye space</s:link>
      up to a given maximum <s:term s:type="term">radius</s:term>.

    <s:paragraph>
      The term <s:term s:type="term">spherical</s:term> comes from the
      fact that the light has a defined radius. Most rendering systems
      instead use <s:term s:type="term">point</s:term> lights that 
      specify multiple <s:term s:type="term">attenuation</s:term> 
      constants to control how light is attenuated over distance. The
      problem with this approach is that it requires solving a quadratic
      equation to determine a minimum bounding sphere that can contain
      the light. Essentially, the programmer/artist is forced to determine 
      "at which radius does the contribution from this light effectively reach
      zero?". With spherical lights, the maximum radius is declared up
      front, and a single falloff value is used to determine the
      attenuation curve within that radius. This makes spherical
      lights more intuitive to use: The programmer/artist simply places a
      sphere within the scene and knows exactly from the radius which
      objects are lit by it. It also means that bounding light volumes
      can be trivially constructed from unit spheres by simply scaling
      those spheres by the light radius, when performing

      The light supports <s:link s:target="r1.dai.lighting.attenuation">attenuation</s:link>

      The final light applied to the surface is given by <s:term s:type="function">spherical</s:term>
      [<s:link-external s:target="haskell/Spherical.hs">Spherical.hs</s:link-external>], where
      <s:term s:type="variable">sr</s:term>, <s:term s:type="variable">sg</s:term>,
      <s:term s:type="variable">sb</s:term> are the red, green, and blue channels,
      respectively, of the surface being lit. The surface-to-light vector 
      <s:term s:type="variable">stl</s:term> is calculated by normalizing the
      negation of the difference between the the current eye space
      <s:term s:type="variable">surface_position</s:term> and the eye space
      origin of the light.
