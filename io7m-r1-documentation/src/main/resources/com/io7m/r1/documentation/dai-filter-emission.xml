    <s:paragraph>
      An <s:term s:type="term">emissive</s:term> surface is a surface
      that appears to emit light. The <s:term s:type="package">${project.parent.name}</s:term> 
      package offers emission as a visual effect implemented as a filter. An optional
      <s:term s:type="term">glow</s:term> effect is provided to allow emissive
      surfaces to appear to have a configurable 
      <s:link-external s:target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_%28optical_phenomenon%29">aura</s:link-external>.
    </s:paragraph>
    <s:paragraph>
      The emission effect is obviously not physically accurate - surfaces do not
      really emit light. The user is expected to make intelligent use of the
      standard <s:term s:type="r1.dai.lighting">light types</s:term> to provide
      lighting, and to use the emission effect to complement them.

    <s:paragraph>
      The plain emission effect without <s:term s:type="term">glow</s:term> is 
      implemented as trivially as possible by sampling the 
      <s:link s:target="r1.dai.deferred.g-buffer">emission</s:link>
      value from a rendered scene's <s:term s:type="term">g-buffer</s:term>,
      multiplying it by the <s:term s:type="term">albedo</s:term> color and then
      simply adding the result to the current pixel color.
    </s:paragraph>
    <s:paragraph>
      The emission effect with <s:term s:type="term">glow</s:term> is implemented
      similarly, except that the <s:term s:type="expression">albedo * emission</s:term>
      term is stored in a separate image, and that image is blurred with a configurable
      <s:term s:type="term">box blur</s:term> before being additively blended over the
      original scene. Higher levels of blurring can give the impression of a dusty
      atmosphere.

      The emission effect without glow is provided by the
      <s:link-external s:target="apidocs/com/io7m/r1/meshes/KImageFilterEmission.html">KImageFilterEmission</s:link-external>
      filter. The emission effect with glow is provided by the
      <s:link-external s:target="apidocs/com/io7m/r1/meshes/KImageFilterEmissionGlow.html">KImageFilterEmissionGlow</s:link-external>
      filter.
