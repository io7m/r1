        <s:paragraph>
          The <s:term s:type="package">${project.parent.name}</s:term> package 
          implements an aggressively minimalist 3D renderer.

          <s:list-unordered>
            <s:list-item>
              A <s:term s:type="term">deferred rendering</s:term> core for 
              <s:term s:type="term">opaque</s:term> objects.
            </s:list-item>
            <s:list-item>
              A <s:term s:type="term">forward renderer</s:term>, supporting
              a subset of the features of the 
              <s:term s:type="term">deferred renderer</s:term>, for 
              rendering <s:term s:type="term">translucent</s:term> objects.
            </s:list-item>
            <s:list-item>
              A full dynamic lighting system, including both
              <s:term s:type="term">basic</s:term> and
              <s:term s:type="term">variance</s:term> shadow mapping. The use
              of <s:term s:type="term">deferred rendering</s:term> allows for
              potentially hundreds of dynamic lights per scene.
            </s:list-item>
            <s:list-item>
              A detailed material system, allowing for artists and developers
              to create surfaces with a wide variety of effects such as 
              <s:term s:type="term">normal mapping</s:term>,
              <s:term s:type="term">environment-mapped reflections</s:term>,
              <s:term s:type="term">generic refraction</s:term>,
              <s:term s:type="term">surface emission</s:term>,
              <s:term s:type="term">mapped specular highlights</s:term>, etc,
              without writing a single line of shader code. All materials are
              immutable but are created via simple mutable builders in code, and so
              are effectively dynamic
                <s:footnote>
                  All materials are immutable once created, but if a material
                  is recreated every frame with varying parameters, the material
                  becomes effectively dynamic.
                </s:footnote>.
            </s:list-item>
            <s:list-item>
              A variety of postprocessing effects such as 
              <s:term s:type="term">box blurring</s:term>, 
              <s:term s:type="term">fast approximate antialiasing (FXAA)</s:term>,
              <s:term s:type="term">color correction</s:term>,
              <s:term s:type="term">bloom</s:term>,
              <s:term s:type="term">screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO)</s:term>, etc.
              Effects can be applied in any order.
            </s:list-item>
            <s:list-item>
              Explicit control over all resource loading and caching. For
              all <s:term s:type="term">transient</s:term> resources
              <s:footnote>
                Such as <s:term s:type="term">shaders</s:term>, 
                <s:term s:type="term">temporary framebuffers</s:term>,
                <s:term s:type="term">shadow maps</s:term>, etc.
              </s:footnote>, the
              programmer is required to provide the renderer with explicit 
              <s:term s:type="term">caches</s:term>, and the caches themselves
              are responsible for allocating and loading resources.
            </s:list-item>
            <s:list-item>
              Extensive use of immutable objects for the purposes of correctness.
              One of the driving design concepts is that the programmer passes
              an immutable "snapshot" of the scene to be rendered to a rendering
              function, and that rendering function will always return the same
              image for that snapshot.
            </s:list-item>
            <s:list-item>
              Simplicity. The implementation consists of a few thousand shaders
              generated at compile-time from the Java <s:term s:type="term">material</s:term> 
              and <s:term s:type="term">light</s:term> types defined in the renderer's
              API. All of the usual bugs that plague programmers using 3D renderers that
              directly expose shaders (such as passing incorrect parameters to shaders,
              forgetting to pass required parameters, etc), are simply not present. The
              system knows every possible <s:term s:type="term">light</s:term> and
              <s:term s:type="term">material</s:term> combination, statically, and
              knows how to pass the right parameters to the shaders that implement them.
              The programmer doesn't have to worry about it.
            </s:list-item>
            <s:list-item>
              Extensive use of static types. As with all
              <s:link-external s:target="http://io7m.com">io7m</s:link-external> packages,
              there is extreme emphasis on using the type system to make it difficult to
              use the APIs incorrectly.
            </s:list-item>
            <s:list-item>
              Portability. The renderer will run on any system supporting either
              OpenGL <s:term s:type="constant">&gt;= 3.0</s:term> or
              OpenGL ES <s:term s:type="constant">&gt;= 3</s:term>.
            </s:list-item>
          </s:list-unordered>
        </s:formal-item>
      </s:subsection>
      <s:subsection>
        <s:subsection-title>Non-features</s:subsection-title>
        <s:paragraph>
          The intention of the <s:term s:type="package">${project.parent.name}</s:term> 
          package is to essentially expose an advanced <s:term s:type="term">fixed-function</s:term>
          rendering pipeline that just happens to provide all of the advanced rendering
          techniques expected of a modern computer game. Features specifically not implemented
          by the package include:
        </s:paragraph>
        <s:formal-item s:kind="marketing">
          <s:formal-item-title>Non-features</s:formal-item-title>
          <s:list-unordered>
            <s:list-item>
              A scene graph. The renderer expects the programmer to provide
              a set of <s:term s:type="term">instances</s:term> (with associated
              <s:term s:type="term">materials</s:term>) and 
              <s:term s:type="term">lights</s:term> once per frame, and the
              renderer will obediently draw exactly those instances. This frees
              the programmer from having to interact with a clumsy and type-unsafe
              "object-oriented" scene graph as with other 3D engines, and from 
              having to try to crowbar their own program's data structures into 
              an existing graph system.
            </s:list-item>
            <s:list-item>
              Spatial partitioning. The renderer knows nothing of the world
              the programmer is trying to render. The programmer is expected to
              have done the work of deciding which <s:term s:type="term">instances</s:term>
              and <s:term s:type="term">lights</s:term> contribute to the current
              image, and to provide only those <s:term s:type="term">lights</s:term>
              and <s:term s:type="term">instances</s:term> for the current frame.
              This means that the programmer is free to use any spatial
              partitioning system desired.
            </s:list-item>
            <s:list-item>
              Input handling. The renderer knows nothing about keyboards, mice, joysticks.
              The programmer passes an immutable snapshot of a scene to the renderer, and
              the renderer returns an image. This means that the programmer is free to use any 
              input system desired without having to painfully integrate their own code with
              an existing input system as with other 3D engines.
            </s:list-item>
            <s:list-item>
              Audio. The renderer makes images, not sounds. This allows programmers to use
              any audio system they want in their programs.
            </s:list-item>
            <s:list-item>
              Skeletal animation. The input to the renderer is a set of triangle
              <s:term s:type="term">meshes</s:term> in the form of
              <s:term s:type="term">vertex buffer objects</s:term>. This means that
              the programmer is free to use any skeletal animation system desired,
              providing that the system is capable of producing 
              <s:term s:type="term">vertex buffer objects</s:term> of the correct type
              as a result.
            </s:list-item>
            <s:list-item>
              Model loading. The input to the renderer is a set of triangle
              <s:term s:type="term">meshes</s:term> in the form of
              <s:term s:type="term">vertex buffer objects</s:term>. This means that
              the programmer is free to use any model loading system desired,
              providing that the system is capable of producing 
              <s:term s:type="term">vertex buffer objects</s:term> of the correct type
              as a result
                <s:footnote>
                  The renderer does define two brutally simple on-disk static
                  <s:term s:type="term">mesh</s:term> formats for the sake of convenience,
                  the test suite, and to store some of its own rendering resources
                  <s:footnote>
                    Such as the mesh shapes required to represent light volumes when
                    performing deferred rendering.
                  </s:footnote>, and provides tools to convert to those formats from
                  <s:term s:type="term">COLLADA</s:term> documents, but the programmer
                  is absolutely not required to use them.
                </s:footnote>.
            </s:list-item>
            <s:list-item>
              Future proofing. The average lifetime of a rendering system is about
              five years. Due to the extremely rapid pace of advancement in graphics
              hardware, the methods use to render graphics
              <s:term s:type="term">today</s:term> will bear almost no relation to those
              used five years into the future. The <s:term s:type="package">${project.parent.name}</s:term>
              package is under no illusion that it will still be relevant in a decade's
              time. It is designed to get work done <s:term s:type="term">today</s:term>,
              using exactly those techniques that are relevant <s:term s:type="term">today</s:term>.
              It will not be indefinitely expanded and grown organically, as this would
              directly contradict the goal of having a 
              <s:term s:type="term">minimalist</s:term> and <s:term s:type="term">correct</s:term> 
              rendering system.
            </s:list-item>
            <s:list-item>
              OpenGL ES 2 support. The ES 2 standard was written as a reaction to the
              insane committee politics that plagued the OpenGL 2.* standards. It is
              crippled to the point that it essentially cannot support almost any of
              the rendering techniques present in the 
              <s:term s:type="package">${project.parent.name}</s:term> package, and is
              becoming increasingly irrelevant as the much saner ES 3 is adopted by
              hardware vendors.
