/**
 * This {@link AWTEventListener} tries to work around a 12 yo bug in the Linux
 * KeyEvent handling for keyboard repeat. Linux apparently implements
 * repeating keypresses by repeating both the {@link KeyEvent#KEY_PRESSED} and
 * {@link KeyEvent#KEY_RELEASED}, while on Windows, one only gets repeating
 * PRESSES, and then a final RELEASE when the key is released. The Windows way
 * is obviously much more useful, as one then can easily distinguish between a
 * user holding a key pressed, and a user hammering away on the key.
 * 
 * This class is an {@link AWTEventListener} that should be installed as the
 * application's first ever {@link AWTEventListener} using the following code,
 * but it is simpler to invoke {@link #install() install(new instance)}:
 * 
 * Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().addAWTEventListener(new
 * {@link SBRepeatingReleasedEventsFixer}, AWTEvent.KEY_EVENT_MASK);
 * 
 * Remember to remove it and any other installed {@link AWTEventListener} if
 * your application have some "reboot" functionality that can potentially
 * install it again - or else you'll end up with multiple instances, which
 * isn't too hot.
 * 
 * Notice: Read up on the {@link Reposted} interface if you have other
 * AWTEventListeners that resends KeyEvents (as this one does) - or else we'll
 * get the event back.
 * 
 * Mode of operation
 * 
 * The class makes use of the fact that the subsequent PRESSED event comes
 * right after the RELEASED event - one thus have a sequence like this:
 * 
 * PRESSED -wait between key repeats- RELEASED PRESSED -wait between key
 * repeats- RELEASED PRESSED etc.
 * 
 * A timer is started when receiving a RELEASED event, and if a PRESSED comes
 * soon afterwards, the RELEASED is dropped (consumed) - while if the timer
 * times out, the event is reposted and thus becomes the final, wanted
 * RELEASED that denotes that the key actually was released.
 * 
 * Inspired by http://www.arco.in-berlin.de/keyevent.html
